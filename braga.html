    <h1>Braga: The archbishops city or Portuguese Rome</h1>
    <div id="Monuments">
        <h2>Cultural monuments</h2>
        <p> Braga is one of the oldest Portuguese cities as well as one of the oldest shristian cities of the world. It was founded during the roman empire over 2000 years ago and named “Bracara Augusta”, since then the residents are called “Bracarence(s)”. In XI century the city was reorganized, receiving the designation of “Braga” by the bishop D. Pedro.  In 1112, the city is donated by the king to the archbishops acquiring a great importance at Iberian level. </p>
        
        <p>“És de Braga / Are you from Braga?”  is a typical Portuguese expression said when someone leaves the door open… but why? At the beginning of XVI century archbishop D. Diogo de Sousa decided to open a new door on the city walls. Since there were no wars at the time and the city already extended for the outside of the walls, they never added a wooden door. The seven other doors were closed at night but that door was always open.</p>
        <p>This expression is also associated with bracarences' great community spirit, since they all new each other and shared everything the house doors were never closed, welcoming everyone.</p>
